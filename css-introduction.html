	<div class="transbox">Cascading Style Sheets (English full name: Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of used to represent HTML (an application of the standard generalized markup language) or XML (a subset of standard generalized markup language) file such as the Style of computer language. CSS can be used to not only modify pages in a static way, but also to format the elements of the page dynamically with various scripting languages. [1] 
CSS enables pixel level precision control over the layout of elements in a web page, supports almost all font styles, and has the ability to edit web objects and model styles. [2] 
CSS provides a style description for HTML markup language and defines how elements are displayed. CSS is a breakthrough in Web design. You can use it to modify a small style to update all the page elements associated with it. 
Overall, CSS has the following features: 
Rich style definitions 
CSS provides a rich document-style look and ability to set text and background attributes; Allows you to create borders for any element, the distance between element borders and other elements, and the distance between element borders and element content; Allows you to change the text's case, modify, and other page effects. 
Easy to use and modify 
CSS style definitions can be, in the style attribute of the HTML element can also be defined in the header section of the HTML document, can also be style declarations in a special CSS file, reference for HTML pages. In summary, CSS stylesheets can store all the style declarations and manage them uniformly. 
In addition, the elements of the same style can be classified, use the same style, can also apply a style to all the HTML tags, with the same name can also be a CSS style assigned to a page element. If you want to modify the style, we only need to find the corresponding style declaration in the style list to modify. 
Multi-page application 
CSS stylesheets can be stored in a single CSS file, so we can use the same CSS stylesheet on multiple pages. CSS stylesheets are theoretically unattached to any page file and can be referenced in any page file. This allows for multiple page styles to be unified. 
cascading 
Simply put, cascading is the same style that is set to one element multiple times, which will use the attribute value of the last set. Such as multiple pages in a site using the same set of CSS style sheets, and some want to use other style, some elements of the page can be aimed at these style alone define a style sheet is applied to the page. These later styles will be rewritten for the previous style Settings, which will be the most set style effects in the browser. 
Page compression 
Defined in using HTML page in the website, often require a lot or repetitive forms and the font element to form all kinds of writing styles, the consequences of doing so is to produce a large number of HTML tags, so as to increase the size of the page file. Placing the style declaration into a CSS stylesheet can greatly reduce the size of the page so that the time it takes to load the page will be greatly reduced. In addition, CSS stylesheets reuse larger programs to reduce page size and reduce download time. [8] 



The working principle of 
edit 
CSS is a language that defines style structures such as fonts, colors, locations, etc., and is used to describe the format and reality of information on a web page. CSS styles can be stored directly in HTML pages or individual style sheets. Either way, style sheets contain rules that apply styles to elements of the specified type. When used externally, the style sheet rule is placed in an external style sheet with file extension _css. 
Style rules are formatting instructions that can be applied to a web page, such as text paragraphs or links. A style rule consists of one or more style attributes and their values. The internal style sheet is placed directly on the page, and the external style sheet is stored in separate documents, and the web page links to the external style sheet through a special TAB. 
The "cascading" in the name CSS indicates how the style sheet rule applies to the HTML document element. Specifically, styles in CSS style sheets form a hierarchy, with more specific styles covering generic styles. The precedence of style rules is determined by CSS based on this hierarchy to achieve cascading effects. </div>
